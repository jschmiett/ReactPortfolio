                <p>Hello there! My name is Jennifer. Several years ago curiosity drove me to try learning to code and I quickly realized just how fun and fulfilling it is for me. I'm a research-driven, detail oriented problem solver who thrives in a collaborative team. When I was a kid I wanted to be an astrophysicist so that I could always be learning new things and am excited to be going into a constantly changing field where there's always new skills and technologies to master.</p>
